<h1>JavaScript DOM Manipulation</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<li>Be able to attach event listeners to DOM elements to respond to events</li>
<li>Be able to access data from the event object</li>
<li>Be able to use the document object to add information to the page by manipulating the DOM</li>
<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Your task is to create a front-end JavaScript application that allows users to input items and see them displayed in a list. Choose a theme for the application, such as a list of endangered Animals / favourite Sports Stars / any other theme of your choice. Users should be able to enter values for different properties relating to the theme (Name, Species and Continent, for example) and see them displayed below.</p>
<h2>MVP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a form in HTML with inputs for relevant data</li>
<li>When the form is submitted, access the data from the form in the form’s <code>submit</code> event object</li>
<li>Create a list in HTML</li>
<li>Append the submitted data to the list</li>
<li>Add a “Delete All” button which clears all of the list items from the list</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Refactor your code, extracting helper functions with single responsibilites to keep each function small and readable</li>
<li>Experiment with adding a new form input and experimenting with a new <input> type eg. Add a radio button input</li>
<li>Style your application with CSS</li>
</ul>
